## Unity Molecular Formula (UMF)

Silica is a glass former. Alumina modifies a glass. Fluxes reduce
melting temperature. The Unity Molecular Formula (UMF) systematically
relates these chemistries to each other in a useful glaze chemistry
shorthand UMF shows the ratio of glass formers to fluxes and can be used
to predict glaze behavior.
