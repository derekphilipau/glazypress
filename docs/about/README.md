# About Glazy

The Glazy website was created by [Derek Au](http://www.derekau.net/).
The Glazy database of ceramic recipes was originally seeded 
with data from [Linda Arbuckle's](http://lindaarbuckle.com) 
 [GlazeChem database](http://lindaarbuckle.com/arbuckle_handouts.html), 
John Sankey's [glaze database](http://www.johnsankey.ca/glazedata.html), 
and [Louis Katz's](http://www.louiskatz.net) [Hyperglaze database](http://falcon.tamucc.edu/~lkatz/allglazes.txt). 

[John Britt](http://johnbrittpottery.com/), 
[Alisa Liskin Clausen](https://www.facebook.com/AlisaLiskinClausenCeramics/), 
[Terry Rorison](http://www.mckeesrocks.com/artist-volunteer-terry-rorison-has-dedicated-life-to-the-arts/) 
and 
[Tara Hagen](http://glazeitorium.blogspot.com/) have also included their glaze tests with images.

Glazy is in continuous development, 
guided by technical input from a number of potters around the world. 
In particular, [Pieter Mostert](http://www.pietermostert.com/) and [Matt Katz](https://www.ceramicmaterialsworkshop.com/) have provided invaluable 
insights and suggestions.
