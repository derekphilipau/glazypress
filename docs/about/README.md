# About

There's no way to adequately credit everyone involved in building what has become the Glazy database.  Throughout the years, thousands of ceramic artists have refined their recipes and generously shared them with others via the mail, publications like Ceramics Monthly, and email lists like Clayart.  Glazy is simply the latest incarnation of a "recipe sharing" tool.

The Glazy database of ceramic recipes was originally seeded with data from [Linda Arbuckle's](http://lindaarbuckle.com)  [GlazeChem database](http://lindaarbuckle.com/arbuckle_handouts.html), John Sankey's [glaze database](http://www.johnsankey.ca/glazedata.html) (which is based on the extensive work by [Alisa Clausen](https://glazy.org/u/alisaclausen)), and [Louis Katz's](http://www.louiskatz.net) [Hyperglaze database](http://falcon.tamucc.edu/~lkatz/allglazes.txt). 

The Glazy website was created by [Derek Au](http://www.derekau.net/).  

[John Britt](http://johnbrittpottery.com/), [Alisa Liskin Clausen](https://www.facebook.com/AlisaLiskinClausenCeramics/), [Terry Rorison](http://www.mckeesrocks.com/artist-volunteer-terry-rorison-has-dedicated-life-to-the-arts/) and [Tara Hagen](http://glazeitorium.blogspot.com/) were early contributors and included their glaze tests with images.

Glazy is in continuous development, guided by technical input from a number of potters around the world. In particular, [Pieter Mostert](http://www.pietermostert.com/) and [Matt Katz](https://www.ceramicmaterialsworkshop.com/) have provided invaluable insights and suggestions.
