# Disclaimer and Health Warning

Glazy takes no responsibility for the recipes in this database. 
You should be aware of the dangers of ceramics materials 
when mixing, applying, and firing glazes. 

**Recipes in this database contain dangerous chemicals that can injure or even kill you through short-term and long-term exposure when ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin.** 

When preparing, mixing, and firing ceramic materials you must take the proper precautions as mandated by local and national regulations.  A respirator must be worn at all times when handling dry materials.

Some ceramic recipes may be toxic even after firing, leaching toxic materials into food or drink.  It is your responsibility to insure that functional ware meets all criteria for safety as mandated by local and national regulations. 

Ceramic recipes "do not travel well" and are very sensitive to 
differences in materials, preparation (seiving and ball milling), 
application, firing, and cooling. Even for well-known and 
well-tested glazes, your results may be significantly different 
from others. Therefore, knowledge of how to test and adjust 
glazes is extremely important.
