# Disclaimer and Health Warning

Glazy takes no responsibility for the recipes in this database. 
You should be aware of the dangers of ceramics materials 
when mixing, applying, and firing glazes. 

**Recipes in this database contain dangerous chemicals that 
can injure or even kill you through short-term and long-term 
exposure when ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin.** 
Even after firing, glazes can leach toxic chemicals into 
food and drink. Ceramicists making functional ware should 
be especially vigilant in ensuring their glazes are food-safe.

Ceramic recipes "do not travel well" and are very sensitive to 
differences in materials, preparation (seiving and ball milling), 
application, firing, and cooling. Even for well-known and 
well-tested glazes, your results may be significantly different 
from others. Therefore, knowledge of how to test and adjust 
glazes is extremely important.
