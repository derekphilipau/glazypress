# Clear Glazes

Clear glazes are a type of "Base Glaze".  They don't have any colorants or opacifiers.
They are usually Glossy, but can also have a Satin finish.
Clear glazes are located in the middle "Bright" region of the Stull Chart.
When too much Alumina or Silica is added to a Clear glaze, then it often changes to a Matte Glaze.

## Mid-Fire

As opposed to low-fire, there are a large number of Mid-Fire Clear glazes in Glazy.  So many, in fact, that it can be difficult to decide which one to test.  One factor to consider is your clay body.  Some Clear glazes will look good on a porcelain clay body, but appear cloudy on darker stoneware clays.
