# Posts

Posts are a timeline of your activity in both Glazy and your studio.

*System Posts* are added automatically whenever you perform an action in Glazy, for example *adding a recipe*, *uploading a photo*, or *creating a recipe batch*.

*User Posts* are created by users like you.  You can create blog posts, support posts, etc.  Creating User Posts are a great way to document your studio progress.
