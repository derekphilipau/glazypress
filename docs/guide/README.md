# Getting Started
  
Before doing anything, please read the
[Disclaimer & Health Warning](/about/health-warning.html)
and be aware of the dangers when mixing, working with and firing
ceramic materials.

## What Device?

Glazy will work on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.  However, due to limited screen size, some information and features may not be displayed on mobile devices.  It's recommended to use tablets or desktops for Glazy if you intend to access more complex Glazy features like creating recipes in the Calculator.

## What Browser?

In an ideal world, there would be multiple healthy browsers that support the same web standards.  
In reality, each browser is slightly different, and it takes time and effort to make a website run on each browser.

Because Glazy lacks resources, we can only test against a single browser, Google Chrome.  
Chrome can be installed on almost any device, from computers to mobile phones.

While Google Chrome is the only "officially" supported browser, [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) also seem to work just fine!
