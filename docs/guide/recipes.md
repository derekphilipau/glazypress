# Recipe Information

## Unity Molecular Formula (UMF)

Silica is a glass former. Alumina modifies a glass. Fluxes reduce
melting temperature. The Unity Molecular Formula (UMF) systematically
relates these chemistries to each other in a useful glaze chemistry
shorthand UMF shows the ratio of glass formers to fluxes and can be used
to predict glaze behavior.

## Stull Charts

### Original Stull Chart

![Original Stull Chart](./STULL_Chart_orig.jpg)

The Glazy Stull Chart overlay was inspired by the work of R.T. Stull and
Matt Katz. Note: The Stull chart was created for glazes with a flux
ratio 0.3 R2O: 0.7 RO and fired to cone 11. There may be variations in
the chart for glazes with different flux ratios fired at different
temperatures.

For more information, see R.T. Stull's original article in 
[Transactions of the American Ceramic Society, Volume 14, pages 62-70](https://books.google.com/books?id=9qwYAQAAIAAJ).

### Glazy Stull Chart

This chart is a work in progress and will be revised.

## Zooming in the chart

Zooming in on the Stull Chart The chart can be zoomed in by clicking and
dragging a rectangle with your mouse. On mobile devices, just pinch and
zoom into the area you want to zoom. To reset the zoom, click the "Reset
zoom" button in the top-right corner of the graph.

## R<sub>2</sub>O:RO Ratio

![R2O:RO Ratio](./ror2oscale.png) 
_The R2O:RO Ratio Scale shown in the Stull Chart._

The ratio of R2O to RO oxides has implications for glaze stability and
expansion.

Matt Katz has demonstrated that a 0.3 R2O: 0.7 RO ratio produces the
most robust glazes at a range of temperatures.

## Glaze Limit Formulas

_Note: As of March 2016 glaze limits are being removed from Glazy in
favor of the Stull chart. The Stull chart seems to be a more reliable
and descriptive guide than glaze limits. The glaze limit table chart
below is retained for reference._

Glaze Limit Formulas are general guidelines for stable, functional base
glazes. There are a wide range of published limit formulas, and a lot of
controversy surrounding them. You will notice that many non-functional,
decorative glazes will exceed glaze limits. If your functional glaze
recipe exceeds a limit range it does not necessarily mean that your
glaze is not safe, rather that you should pay attention to those oxides
and perhaps consider modifying the recipe. Conversely, you should not
assume that your glaze is stable simply because it falls within a glaze
limit range.

## Similar Base Recipes

If two recipes consist of the same base materials (not including
additional materials) in the same amounts (within 1%), then they are
considered similar.
  * Two Leach 4321 glazes (40% Feldspar, 30% Silica, 20% Whiting, 10%
Kaolin) may be similar even if their additional oxides differ. For
instance, Leach White is a 4321 glaze with added Zircopax, while Leach
Celadon is a 4321 glaze with added iron. These two glazes are considered
similar by Glazy.
  * A Leach 4321 glaze recipe with 40% Potash Feldspar is similar to the
same glaze recipe with 40% Custer Feldspar because the materials or
their parent materials are the same.
  * A Leach 4321 glaze recipe with 40% Potash Feldspar is not similar to the
same glaze recipe with 40% Soda Feldspar because the materials (and
their parent materials) are different.
  * A Leach 4321 glaze recipe with 39.5% Feldspar and a Leach 4321 glaze
with 40% Feldspar are considered similar because the material amounts
only vary by %1.

## Similar Unity Formulas

Two recipes are considered to have similar unity formulas if their
oxides do not differ more than .05 For this comparison, K2O and Na2O are
combined (KNaO).

_Note: Recipes that have similar unity formulas do not necessarily exhibit
similar fired characterisitics._

## Exporting Recipes

Recipes can be exported as a Recipe Card- an image containing the recipe
photograph, name, and recipe details.

Recipes can be exported to your favorite glaze calculation software.
Currently, only Insight and GlazeChem are supported, but hopefully more
export formats will be added in the future.

To export a recipe, simply select "Export" from the menu on the recipe page. The
Recipe Card image can be saved on your computer or shared with others
online. The downloaded glaze calculation software text file can be
imported into your program.

## Hazards

_09/2016 Note: This is a new feature. If a recipe material is not
listed, that material's data has not yet been added. Some materials only
have GHS ratings, while others only have HMIS ratings. Warnings differ
between systems and countries. Glazy does not take any responsibility
for accuracy of linked SDS information. Contact your ceramics supplier
for safety information for your specific materials._

You must wear a NIOSH certified mask whenever mixing ceramic materials.
All materials should be handled and fired in well-ventilated areas to
avoid the risk of inhalation.

Lack of a warning does NOT mean that a material is safe.

From hazard warnings alone it is difficult to determine **when** and **how** a
given material may be harmful. Some materials might be relatively safe
to use when making glazes, but toxic when volatized during firing or
leached from a non-durable fired glaze. Other materials might be
relatively safe in a durable fired glaze, but extremely toxic in raw
form in the studio. It is up to the individual to understand the risks
of each material and take necessary precautions.
