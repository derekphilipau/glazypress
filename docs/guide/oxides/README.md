# Periodic Table and Oxides

## Color-coding for oxides

In Glazy, multiple color systems are used in different contexts.

For example, the Glazy [Unity Molecular Formula (UMF) Chart](/guide/recipes/#the-unity-molecular-formula-umf-chart) uses color to differentiate between Stull Regions as well as R2O:RO Ratio.

In Glazy, metallic oxides are also color-coded according to their element group.
