# Support Glazy

## Why Support Glazy?

Glazy is 100% free for use by anyone.

Glazy doesn't spy on you, sell your information to third parties, or otherwise profit on you in any way.

Glazy is the only online glaze calculation software that promotes sharing recipes and test results so that potters can learn more about ceramic chemistry while verifying and improving results.

## How to Support Glazy

The best way to support Glazy is to use it! Uploading images of glazes, verifying existing recipes, and sharing your own recipes helps Glazy become a more trustworthy source of ceramics information.

**Glazy will always remain open and free.**  But the Glazy code takes many hours each month to write and maintain, as does providing support to users, creating tests, and importing new data into the database. The web servers that Glazy runs on cost more as Glazy grows.

### Alchemist Badge

In order to show appreciation for ALL contributors, the Alchemist badge was added.  This badge is shown when a user has uploaded 20 or more photos to Glazy.  Photos are essential to understanding what a recipe looks like, as well as to compare differences between materials, preparation, and firing types.
